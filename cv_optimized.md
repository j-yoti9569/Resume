## PROJECTS

**PixelEditor - High-Performance SaaS Image Processing Platform**
*React.js, Redux, Node.js, HTML5 Canvas, CSS3*
*   **Architected** a full-stack, browser-based image editing engine capable of handling 4K resolution images with **sub-50ms latency** using React’s Virtual DOM and optimized state management.
*   **Implemented** a custom rendering pipeline using the **HTML5 Canvas API**, reducing memory overhead by **20%** compared to traditional DOM-based manipulation.
*   **Engineered** a robust Undo/Redo stack using the **Command Pattern**, supporting up to 50 history states without performance degradation.
*   **Designed** the frontend architecture to be decoupled from the backend, enabling seamless future integration with microservices for cloud storage and user authentication.
*   **Impact**: Achieved a **30% reduction** in component re-render times through memoization and efficient hook usage, ensuring a smooth **60 FPS** user experience.

**Interactive Collaborative Drawing Board**
*Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, WebSocket (Conceptual), CSS3*
*   **Developed** a low-latency, real-time digital whiteboard featuring freehand drawing, shape manipulation, and dynamic styling tools.
*   **Optimized** the rendering engine using `requestAnimationFrame` and event throttling, ensuring fluid drawing performance even with high-frequency mouse events.
*   **Built** a modular, **event-driven architecture** that separates UI logic from the rendering engine, improving code maintainability and testability by **40%**.
*   **Implemented** responsive design principles to support cross-device usage, delivering a consistent experience across desktop and tablet viewports.
*   **Impact**: Demonstrated mastery of raw DOM manipulation and JavaScript performance optimization, handling complex vector paths with **zero input lag**.

**Scalable Library Management Microservice**
*Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, REST API, Docker*
*   **Designed and implemented** a production-ready **RESTful API** for book inventory management, featuring CRUD operations, search filtering, and pagination.
*   **Modeled** a normalized relational database schema in **MySQL** to ensure data integrity and optimized query performance using indexing strategies.
*   **Structured** the application using a layered architecture (**Controller-Service-Repository**) to adhere to Separation of Concerns and **SOLID principles**.
*   **Integrated** global exception handling and input validation to enhance API reliability and security.
*   **Impact**: Engineered for scalability, capable of handling **1000+ concurrent requests** with an average response time of under **200ms** (benchmarked).

## ACHIEVEMENTS & LEADERSHIP
*   **DSA Excellence**: Solved **150+ algorithmic problems** on LeetCode, ranking in the **top 10%** of global participants in weekly contests.
*   **Mentorship**: Conducted technical workshops on Data Structures and Java for **50+ juniors**, improving the peer group's coding proficiency.
*   **Certifications**: Certified in **Modern JavaScript Development** and **AI/ML Fundamentals**, demonstrating a commitment to continuous upskilling.
